That's right, a high-level solution just landed on GitHub 🚀 for better transparency and better standards in the development process. We have been doing since July 14, 2021 with more than **6 years of experience**, and we are very proud that v4Guard has become what it is today at the hands of a community of developers and communities that support the project on a daily basis.

### 🍿 Monitor the health of your community in real time.
We are focused on replacing any fraud detection solution with a smart and easy to use solution that guarantees the highest level of protection 👀. With 6 years of industry experience, v4Guard knows what is important to server owners, we have been built after listening to the frustrations of the community when dealing with the different solutions on the market ✨. 

### 💨 The most accurate VPN detection service in the industry.
Using honeypots & traps, blacklist, data analytics and customer feedback loops, we are able to detect compromised connections and dangerous users to a significantly greater degree than any other anti-fraud service. v4Guard also allows for the most flexible and customizable scoring configuration to tailor the service to your audience. Never worry about false positives again, v4Guard's detection is perfectly suited to any site or application.
